CLKC-8#1 Advisory
BUFGCE_DIV with active CE or DIVIDE not 1 has BUFG driver  
The BUFGCE_DIV cell i_gmii2rgmii/i_rgmii_Div4 i_gmii2rgmii/i_rgmii_Div4/I pin (and CE is ACTIVE or BUFGCE_DIVIDE is not 1) is driven by BUFGCE clock buffer Mercury_XU5_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clkout4_buf. It should be reconnected in parallel to the driving clock buffer in order to reduce skew. Cascaded buffers introduce skew that can lead to difficult or impossible timing closure.

CLKC-56#1 Advisory
MMCME4 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME4_ADV cell Mercury_XU5_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) Mercury_XU5_i/zynq_ultra_ps_e/U0/buffer_pl_clk_1.PL_CLK_1_BUFG and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
